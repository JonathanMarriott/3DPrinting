Our project is to develop a program which will read in a post-slice 3D print model and check whether or not the model has all required supports.

Depending on our progress, we would also like to implement features to add in these supports, and to optimise the supports in the following ways:

- use the least possible material
- be as easy to remove as possible
- merge/bridge supports where possible

The program must accept the basic file format, which will be a .zip file containing many .png files, with each representing one layer of the model.
We would also like to be able to read in a second, more complicated file type, but this will depend on our progress.
