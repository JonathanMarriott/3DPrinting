User Storiy

  The user wants to print their 3D model that they have created in a CAD program. They have this model saved in its splices. 
  In order to avoid the print from failing they want to use our program to scan through the model and add supports to the model
  so that it can be printed. The program should be a .exe executable that they can run on their computer. The program should have
  an upload/import option to load the splice into it. It should then analyse it and output a new set of splices with now added supports.
  The user can then simply sned this file straight to the printer and it should be adequately supported so that the print is successful.
